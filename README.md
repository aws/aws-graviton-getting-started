# Getting started with AWS Graviton

This repository is meant to help new users start using the Arm-based AWS Graviton and Graviton2 processors which power the latest generation of Amazon EC2 instances. While it calls out specific features of the Graviton processors themselves, this repository is also generically useful for anyone running code on Arm.

# Building for Graviton and Graviton2
The Graviton CPU (powering [A1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/a1/) instances) supports Arm V8.0 and includes support for CRC and crypto extensions.

The Graviton2 CPU (powering [M6g/M6gd](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m6/), [C6g/C6gd](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6/), and [R6g/R6gd](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/r6/) instances) uses the Neoverse-N1 core and supports Arm V8.2 plus several
other architectural extensions. In particular, Graviton2 supports the Large
System Extensions (LSE) which improve locking and synchronization performance
across large systems. In addition, it has support for fp16 and 8-bit dot
productions for machine learning, and relaxed consistency-processor consistent
(RCpc) memory ordering.

# Optimizing for Graviton
Please refer [here](optimizing.md) for debugging and profiling information.

# Recent software updates relevant to Graviton
There is a huge amount of activity in the Arm software ecosystem and improvements are being
made on a daily basis. As a general rule later versions of compilers and language runtimes
should be used whenever possible. The table below includes known recent changes to popular
packages that improve performance (if you know of others please let us know).

Package | Version | Improvements
--------|---------|-------------
bazel	| [3.4.1+](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/3.4.1) | Pre-built bazel binary for Graviton/Arm64. 
ffmpeg  |   4.3+  | Improved performance of libswscale by 50% with better NEON vectorization which improves the performance and scalability of ffmpeg multi-thread encoders. The changes are available in FFMPEG version 4.3.
OpenH264 | [2.1.1+](https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases/tag/v2.1.1) | Pre-built Cisco OpenH264 binary for Graviton/Arm64. 
PCRE2   | 10.34+  | Added NEON vectorization to PCRE's JIT to match first and pairs of characters. This may improve performance of matching by up to 8x. This fixed version of the library now is shipping with Ubuntu 20.04 and PHP 8.
PHP     | 7.4+    | PHP 7.4 includes a number of performance improvements that increase perf by up to 30%
pip     | 19.3+   | Enable installation of python wheel binaries on Graviton
ruby    | [un-released](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3393) | Enable arm64 optimizations that improve perfomance by as much as 40% on included benchmarks.

# Containers on Graviton
You can run Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, and Amazon EKS on Graviton. Amazon ECR supports multi-arch containers.
Please refer [here](containers.md) for information about running container-based workloads on Graviton.

# Operating Systems

Please check [here](os.md) for more information about which operating system to run on Graviton based instances.

# Known issues and workarounds

## Python installation on some Linux distros
The default installation of pip on some Linux distributions is old \(<19.3\) to install binary wheel packages released for Graviton.  To work around this, it is recommended to upgrade your pip installation using:
```
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Cassandra installion on Ubuntu or Debian-based distros
As of July 7th 2020, [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) will fail to install [via Debian package](https://cassandra.apache.org/download/) on Graviton instances running Ubuntu or other Debian-based distros. (Full details in the [open JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-15889).) The workaround is to specify `amd64` as the desired arch. Cassandra is not arch-specific, so the "amd64" package works normally:
```
deb [arch=amd64] https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/debian 311x main
```

Note that Redhat variants like Amazon Linux 2 avoid this issue. In our out of box Cassandra performance testing (early July 2020), Amazon Linux 2 using [the Corretto 8 JDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/amazon-linux-install.html) outperformed Ubuntu 20.04 by up to 23%.

# Additional resources
Linaro and Arm maintain a tool ([Sandpiper](http://sandpiper.linaro.org/)) to
search for packages across multiple OSes and Docker official images. This can
be useful to see which versions of a package exist in distributions --
especially when there is a performance improvement in a particular version.
