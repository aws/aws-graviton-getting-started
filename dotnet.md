# .NET Core and .NET 5+ on Graviton

.NET Core is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications originally written by Microsof, and now opensource. .NET Core has supported Linux 64-bit ARM since v2.1.0, but .NET 5 and higher offers hardware specific optimizations in the .NET libraries.

.NET applications are written in the C#, F#, or Visual Basic programming language. Code is compiled into a language-agnostic Common Intermediate Language (CIL). Compiled code is stored in assembliesâ€”files with a .dll or .exe file extension.

When an app runs, the CLR takes the assembly and uses a just-in-time compiler (JIT) to turn it into machine code that can execute on the specific architecture of the computer it is running on. 

Here are some noteworthy performance upgrades:

## .NET 5 \[released 2020/11/10\]
The .NET team has significantly improved performance with .NET 5, both generally and for ARM64. The team focused on ARM64-specific optimizations in the .NET libraries and evaluation of code quality produced by RyuJIT and resulting outcomes.

## .NET Framework 
.NET Framework is the original implementation of .NET. .NET Framework does not support Linux hosts, and Windows hosts are not yet suported on Graviton.
