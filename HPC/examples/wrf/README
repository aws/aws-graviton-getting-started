This is the benchmark case for a 12km CONUS simulation
The code used was WPSV4.2 and WRFV4.2.2

The original simulation was a 12 hour simulation from
2019-11-26_12 to 2019-11-27_00
and then a restart simulation from 
2019-11-26_23 to 2019-11-27_00

Data are GFS 0.25 degree analysis (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds084.1/)
real.exe was run with 36 processors on a single node
wrf.exe was run with 144 processors on 4 nodes


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included files:
	namelist.input - set up to run a 1 hour restart, using the files provided
	wrfbdy_d01 - boundary conditions created by the real program
	wrfout_d01_2019-11-27_00:00:00.orig - final wrf output file from the original 12 hour wrf simulation
	wrfrst_d01_2019-11-26_23:00:00 - restart file created during the original 12 hour wrf simulation
	rsl.out.0000 - simulation log file/output from the original 12 hour wrf simulation
	runwrf.csh - batch script used to run wrf for the original simulation and the restart simulation
	*.dat - data files needed for Thompson microphysics (these are usually generated during wrf, but takes a while to produce)
	diffwrf.py - script to compare original wrfout file with new wrfout file that will be generated with a restart simulation
	*.png - sample PNG files of acceptable differences

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN

Ensure necessary files are in the runn directory - wrfrst*, wrfbdy_d01, namelist.input, and *.dat
Run wrf.exe (using the necessary requirements of the system - e.g., batch script, mpirun, etc.)
When the simulation completes, there should be a new wrfout_d01_2019-11-27_00:00:00 file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO COMPARE OUTPUT

Make sure python is installed on the system
issue the command:
> python diffwrf.py wrfout_d01_2019-11-27_00:00:00.orig wrfout_d01_2019-11-27_00:00:00

Below is a sample of the differences between a simulation using an Intel compiler and a simulation using a GNU compiler.
The means should be about zero. The listed standard deviations are reasonable and what would be expected between identical
simulations on different systems, or using different compiler/library options.
